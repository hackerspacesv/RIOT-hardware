Hackerspace San Salvador Contiki Development Boards
===================================================
This repository contains all the design files for the boards supported by the
[Contiki OS](http://www.contiki-os.org/) port mantained by the [Hackerspace
San Salvador](http://hackerspace.teubi.co/). You can find the Contiki port 
for the supported boards over
[https://github.com/hackerspacesv/contiki-hssv](https://github.com/hackerspacesv/contiki-hssv).

### Current boards supported
* **ATSAMR21 Breakout Board**: A development board to accelerate the deployment of
  IEEE 802.15.4 based networks on the 2.4Ghz band. It is based on the
  ATSAMR21G18-MR210UA module wich also includes support for antenna-diversity and
  a crypto-acceleration chip. This board was designed to be breadboard-friendly
  and includes USB support and power & LiPo battery management.
* **ATZB-RF-233-1-C breakout**: This is a breadboard-friendly breakout board for the
  module ATZB-RF-233-1-C, this module includes the easy-to-use AT8RF233 radio with
  a front-end-module with a Power-Amplifier & Low-Noise-Amplifier (PA/LNA) to greatly
  extend the range of the radio of IEEE 802.15.4 networks on the 2.4GHz band.

### Planned support
* **ATZB-RF-233-1-C breakout for the Omega Onion**: The Omega Onion is a low-cost
  system-on-a-module that runs a lightweight version of GNU/Linux. This breakout board
  should facilitate the creation of low-cost WiFi-802.15.4 bridges and edge routers.
